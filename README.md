#Words
It's like Boggle. But with angular.

##Features
It's Boggle. Same scoring system. Go ahead and play

##Upcoming Features
 - Better add/remove letter features (right now, you can't really "remove" a letter from the string)
 - Other languages!
 - Ability to "Load" your friends' boards (so you can beat their high scores and stuff)

##Thanks To
 - [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page). Seriously. It's the only API I could find that just right away let me grab some useable "is this a valid English word" info.
